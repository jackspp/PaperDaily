* [Reptile](On First-Order Meta-Learning Algorithms)
> Extremly simliar to Hinton's LOOKAHEAD. Why fast weight is useful? **TODO**
* [Meta Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00837). 	
> This paper is kind of a **DISASTER**, but the idea is very interesting. please check [blog](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/11/30/meta-learning.html)

* [Matching Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04080)
> Kind of like Siame network. Non-parametric method. No need to train. However, limited to **Classification**?
